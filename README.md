# Hi! I'm just a mexican guy on it's way to improve some data analysis skills.
This is my data analyst portfolio with some of my projects I've created in my Business Analytics degree.
You will find different types of projects, from games, to TV series prediction models, to unsupervised machine learning for consumer behavior.


 Here is the detail about each project:
| File Name     | Project Name  | Course        | Details       |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |-------------  |
| A2 - Team 5 - Deliverable Final.ipynb  | Naïve Bayes classifier system in Python  | Data Science: Python  | The goal of this project was to build a **Naïve Bayes classifier** system in Excel. And through the aid of a Python script to prep the data and create training and testing subsets.
| Patron_Fernando_A1_Classification_Analysis.ipynb | Game of Thrones Classification Model Development  | Machine Learning  |  To build a predictive model on a binary response variable and find out what is the probability that a character survives and what are the variables for this to happen.
| Patron_Fernando_A1_Regression_Analysis.ipynb  | Birthweight Regression Analysis  |  Machine Learning  |  In this project I analyzed which were the factors that influenced the birthweight and in what proportion they can impact either positively or negatively.
|  Team_6_A2_Analysis.ipynb  |  Unsupervised Learning Analysis: Mobile App Research Survey | Machine Learning  |  The goal of this project was to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data about consumer behavior towards app usage.
|  The Vortex.ipynb  | The Vortex: A Text Adventure Game  |  Data Science: Python  | This was my first project I ever crated in my masters. It's about a text adventure game where the player needs to make certain decisions to finish and win the game.
| Mad Libs - Team Assignment.ipynb  |  Mad Libs Introduction  |  Data Science: Python  | This was my first team project in the masters. The purpose of it was to create a Mad Libs where the user would fill in the blanks to give the narrative to the story. The result is usually quite funny.
